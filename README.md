## To obtain the code written by the Macro/Systematic Strategies group, follow the instructions below.

#### Instructions for Mac users

Open Terminal and type "python --version" into the command prompt. Your python version should be 3.0 or greater for compatibility with our code. Otherwise, you need to download a more recent version of python. I recommend that you install the Anaconda python distribution, which can be found at https://www.continuum.io/downloads.

If you do not already have a github account, create one at www.github.com.

Once you create an account, type "git --version into the command prompt. If you do not have git installed, go to https://git-scm.com/downloads and download git.

Next, confirm that you have collaboration permissions for the systematic_investment and systematic_analyses repositories. If you have not received an email invite, send an email to david.adelberg@yale.edu requesting an invitation.

In the command prompt, navigate to the directory where you would like to store the downloaded files (the cd, ls and mkdir commands will be useful for this.) Then, type "git clone "
