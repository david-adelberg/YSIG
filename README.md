#### Instructions for Mac users

Open Terminal and type "python --version" into the command prompt. Your python version should be 3.0 or greater for compatibility with our code. Otherwise, you need to download a more recent version of python. I recommend that you install the Anaconda python distribution, which can be found at https://www.continuum.io/downloads.
